# Building Agentic Workflows with Fathym EaC and Synaptic

Welcome to the **Getting Started** guide for building agentic workflows with **Fathym’s Everything as Code (EaC)** and **Synaptic AI**. This guide will walk you through how to use **Fathym open-source technology** to create agentic workflows, leveraging the power of **EaC** and **Synaptic** to automate, orchestrate, and scale enterprise processes.

In this **Golden Path** configuration, we provide a streamlined approach to harnessing Fathym's infrastructure to create intelligent, collaborative workflows using multi-agent systems.

## What are Agentic Workflows?

Agentic workflows refer to automated processes that rely on **agents**—autonomous units that perform specific tasks or coordinate across different systems. These agents work collaboratively, often as part of a larger, multi-agent system, to complete complex workflows efficiently. In **Fathym**, these workflows are constructed and orchestrated via **EaC** and powered by **Synaptic** to deliver **AI-driven automation**, allowing for dynamic decision-making, task execution, and workflow scaling.

## Fathym’s Everything as Code (EaC)

**Everything as Code (EaC)** is the foundation of Fathym’s open-source ecosystem, designed to manage and automate infrastructure, applications, data, and AI workflows. With **EaC**, users can declaratively define their infrastructure and processes, ensuring that complex workflows are consistent, repeatable, and scalable.

In the context of agentic workflows, **EaC** provides:

- **Declarative Management**: Define workflows, infrastructure, and agents in a code-driven manner.
- **Modularity**: Combine prebuilt modules (e.g., infrastructure, applications, data, and AI) with custom configurations to automate and orchestrate processes.
- **Scalability**: Automatically scale workflows based on system demand or external triggers, ensuring seamless operation across enterprise environments.

## Synaptic AI: Powering Multi-Agent Systems

**Synaptic AI** serves as the AI engine driving Fathym’s agentic workflows. Synaptic provides a **multi-agent framework** that enables AI agents to collaborate in real-time, making decisions, executing tasks, and adapting dynamically based on the workflow's requirements.

Key features of Synaptic within agentic workflows include:

- **Collaborative Multi-Agent Systems**: Deploy and manage teams of AI agents that can autonomously handle tasks and coordinate across workflows.
- **Hierarchical Agentic Teams**: Build agentic systems that operate in hierarchical structures, enabling complex workflows with supervisory agents managing sub-agents.
- **Dynamic AI Automation**: Synaptic AI agents integrate with EaC to automate decisions and workflows, providing real-time adaptability in response to changing conditions.

## The Golden Path Configuration for Agentic Workflows

The **Golden Path** represents a streamlined, best-practice configuration for creating agentic workflows using Fathym’s **EaC** and **Synaptic**. This configuration includes:

1. **Defining the Infrastructure**: Use EaC to declaratively define your cloud infrastructure, including hosting environments, data pipelines, and application deployment.

2. **Configuring the Agents**: Leverage **Synaptic** to configure the AI agents that will participate in your workflows. These agents can perform tasks such as data analysis, decision-making, or coordinating between different systems.

3. **Orchestrating the Workflow**: Use **EaC** modules (e.g., applications, data, and AI) to orchestrate workflows, automating task distribution among agents and integrating agents into existing enterprise workflows.

4. **Automation and Scaling**: The Golden Path configuration ensures that agentic workflows can scale automatically based on workload or specific triggers. Agents can be added or removed dynamically to meet operational demands.

## Example: Creating an Agentic Workflow

Let’s walk through an example of how to build an agentic workflow:

### Step 1: Define the Infrastructure
Use **EaC** to configure the cloud infrastructure that will host your agents. This can include defining the hosting environment, setting up data pipelines, and managing the applications the agents will interact with.

```typescript
// Example infrastructure configuration with EaC
const infrastructure = {
  cloud: 'aws',
  applications: ['data-pipeline', 'ai-engine'],
  scaling: { auto: true }
};
```

### Step 2: Configure AI Agents
Next, configure your AI agents using **Synaptic**. These agents can be designed to handle specific tasks, such as processing incoming data or making real-time decisions.

```typescript
// Example Synaptic AI agent configuration
const agentConfig = {
  name: 'DataProcessor',
  tasks: ['data-ingestion', 'real-time-analysis'],
  triggers: ['new-data', 'threshold-reached']
};
```

### Step 3: Orchestrate the Workflow
Use EaC to orchestrate the workflow, ensuring that agents are deployed to the correct infrastructure and that they collaborate efficiently.

```typescript
// Example workflow orchestration
const workflow = {
  agents: ['DataProcessor', 'DecisionMaker'],
  workflowSteps: [
    'data-ingestion',
    'analysis',
    'decision-making'
  ],
  scaling: { dynamic: true }
};
```

### Step 4: Automate and Scale
With the workflow in place, the system can scale dynamically based on external triggers or workload requirements. New agents can be spun up as needed, and processes can be modified in real time to adapt to changes.

## Integrating with Fathym's Everything as Code

The agentic workflows you build can be integrated with other parts of the **EaC ecosystem**, such as:

- **Applications Module**: Define how applications interact with agents and how they are hosted, processed, or routed within the workflow.
- **Clouds Module**: Automate cloud infrastructure management, ensuring agents have access to the resources they need.
- **Data Pipelines**: Incorporate agentic workflows into data flows for real-time data processing and decision-making.

## Conclusion

By combining the power of **Fathym's EaC** and **Synaptic AI**, you can build robust agentic workflows that automate and orchestrate enterprise processes. With the Golden Path configuration, you can easily define infrastructure, deploy agents, and manage workflows in a flexible, scalable, and adaptive manner.
