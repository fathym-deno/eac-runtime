# EaC Runtime - Deploy
 The EaC Runtime can be deployed in a myriad of ways. We already looked at how to use a Docker to deploy to our local system. Using Docker, we can also empower deployments to the Cloud and at the edge.

## Local Deployments

Using a local Docker deployment is a great way to share the EaC Runtime with other groups that may be creating other micro applications for your solution. In addition, Docker serves as the backbone for deploying your containers to many cloud and edge hosting targets. 

## Cloud Deployments

It is often times undesirable to maintain hardware to deploy the EaC Runtime. For this reason, you may want to deploy to any number of cloud service providers. You can use Deno Deploy, Azure, AWS or many more options to host your EaC Runtime.

## Edge Deployments

Referring to more than just edge runtime hosts like Deno Deploy, you can make the EaC Runtime a part of your application delivery architecture. Deploy it on IoT devices, in smart buildings, or as part of your industrial application edge.
