# EaC Runtime - Teams

When developing micro applicatinos as a team, it is important to have a unified way to bring solutions together. The EaC Runtime was built for this purpose with the goal of providing a dev to production workflow that minimizes code changes.

## Development

One of the main goals of a micro application architecture is breaking the work into many parts, allowing multiple teams to work together to deliver a complete solution. Information on how teams can use

Details on how, once the runtime is configured by one team and its container image posted to a container registery, developers of micro applications can use the runtime locally during development. 

## Testing

Leveraging an orchestrated micro applications architecture can improve team workflows. Providing ways to test multiple versions of an application in tandom, providing easy pathways for release and rollback.
