# Introduction to EaC (Everything as Code) Runtime

## Overview
The EaC Runtime is a powerful runtime environment for DenoJS that allows you to effortlessly orchestrate micro frontend applications. It provides a wide range of features including redirect, proxy, OAuth, generative AI chat, and hosting for both single-page applications (SPA) and static sites.

The core concept behind the EaC Runtime is the configuration of an EaC JSON file. By leveraging this configuration file, you can easily define and customize various aspects of your micro frontend application, enabling you to enhance its functionality and adapt it to your specific requirements.

## EaC JSON Configuration
At the heart of the EaC Runtime is the EaC JSON configuration file. This file serves as a central point for defining all the necessary configurations for your micro frontend application. By leveraging a configuration-based approach, you can easily manage and modify your application's behavior without the need for extensive code changes.

The EaC JSON configuration allows you to specify a wide range of settings, including:

- **Redirects**: Define redirect rules to redirect incoming requests based on various criteria.
- **Proxies**: Configure proxy settings to forward incoming requests to backend services or other external resources.
- **OAuth**: Set up OAuth authentication for your application, allowing users to securely sign in with their preferred identity providers.
- **Generative AI Chat**: Enable generative AI chat capabilities to add interactive and intelligent conversation capabilities to your applications without writing any code.
- **Hosting**: Define the hosting settings for your single-page applications (SPAs) and static sites, allowing you to serve them with ease.

## Getting Started
To get started with the EaC Runtime, follow these steps:

1. [https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation](Install DenoJS) on your system if you haven't already done so.
2. [./docs/getting-started/install](Create an EaC Runtime project) and setup the configuration file for your micro frontend application.
3. Configure the necessary settings within the EaC JSON file according to your requirements, such as redirects, proxies, OAuth, generative AI chat, and hosting configuration.
4. Save the EaC JSON configuration file in a location accessible to your DenoJS project.
5. Execute the EaC Runtime using a command line interface, providing the path to your EaC JSON configuration file as a parameter.

With these steps, you can harness the power of EaC Runtime to effortlessly orchestrate your micro frontend applications and leverage its various features for enhanced functionality.

## Conclusion
The EaC Runtime empowers developers to easily orchestrate micro frontend applications by leveraging a configuration-based approach. By configuring an EaC JSON file, you can define redirects, proxies, OAuth, generative AI chat, and hosting settings, among others, thereby enhancing your application's capabilities without extensive code changes.

With the EaC Runtime, you can streamline the development and deployment of your micro frontend applications, enabling you to focus more on creating innovative experiences for your users.
